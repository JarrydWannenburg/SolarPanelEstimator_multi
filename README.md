# SolarPanelEstimator_multi

With this estimator, users can specify detailed information of a solar panel system of interest or use default values provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). After entering information specific to the solar panels and selecting the preferred datasource, the estimator will provide a breakdown of energy costs and outputs expected by using these solar panels. This estimator also estimates the optimal number of panels needed to meet a user's specified annual energy demand. This estimator is particularly useful for the design of new solar panel installations. 

_This version of the estimator is what I had finished by the end of my assistantship (May 2022), so a few bugs remain_.
